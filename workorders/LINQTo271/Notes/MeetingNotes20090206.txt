FINISHED:

PENDING:
  Crew Assignments:
    Clicking 'Start' should show the print form.  Clicking 'End' should show the finalization form.  Clicking 'Save' on the finalization
    form should ask 'Is the work complete?'.  Clicking yes will 'finalize' the work order, otherwise any changes will simply be recorded,
    and work can procede on that job.

    The field workers shouldn't be able to see their work in advance, only the work for the given date.

  Input Form:
    The safety stuff (traffic control required?, street opening permit required?) should only display when Requester is Employee, I'm
    not sure why that didn't work.

    Local Government Info box still does not show when Local Government is chosen as the requester as it should.  Same with Employee.

    In the history table, if an existing order shows that's not completed, the Save button's validation should also prompt with
    "There is an existing order for this asset, which has not been completed.  Are you sure you want to create a new order?".

  Scheduling:
    Search Screen:
      Selecting a specific asset type should filter the descriptions of work (this needs to happen for another form as well).

  Finalization:
    RESTORATION.

    Need Valves operated, hours of shutdown, and # of customers affected.  Valves operated becomes required if hours of shutdown
    and/or # of customers affected are entered.

    Which Valves were turned -
      Do NOT need the valve between, just which two were turned.

    Need to get into the valve inspection screen for valve work orders, probably as a popup.  It should popluate the OpCntr
    and town from the values on the current form.

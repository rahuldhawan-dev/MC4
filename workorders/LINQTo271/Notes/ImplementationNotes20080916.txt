FINISHED:
1. Add "Call Center" RequestedBy value.

2. Setup validation rules for WorkOrder regarding RequestedBy value:
 - "Customer" to require street number, and to include (optionally)
   phone number, extra contact info (notes-style field?), and ServiceOrderNumber
   (currently called ServiceNumber, must rename)

 - "Employee" to require RequestingEmployee

3. Nearest Cross Street is always a required field.

4. Description of Work needs to be ripped from the source access database,
   filtered out by asset type, and put into their own class/table

8. Setup validation rules for WorkOrder regarding AssetType value:
   - "Valve" to require that a valid valve be entered.

   - "Hydrant" to require that a valid hydrant be entered.

12. Once an asset has been chosen or a street address entered, need to display
    table of all work orders recorded for that given asset and/or address.

PENDING:
2. Setup validation rules for WorkOrder regarding RequestedBy value:
 - "Local Government" to require some field for information on specifically
   who requested the order (such as a notes field. this is labeled "official's
   info in the demo, is that ok?)

 - "Call Center" to require ServiceOrderNumber 

5. Need "Add Street" functionality for work order input screen.  This cannot go
   unchecked however, as blanketly allowing users to add streets to the system
   is pretty dangerous (current design doesn't allow for this project to do
   inserts, updates, or deletes to existing tables from MapCall).  We need to
   decide who can add streets, because the people in the fields should not be
   allowed IMO.  Just requiring that a report of all user-added streets be run
   once a month is not enough, because that will not get done.  If this becomes
   an issue, I will remove the functionality.

6. "Service ID" is actually PremiseNumber when AssetType is Service.

7. Asset type to be configurable by operating center (with valve and hydrant as
   static, since everyone has those).  I think that we should just start by
   defining what NJ7 needs, as it is the first rollout target.

8. Setup validation rules for WorkOrder regarding AssetType value:
   - "Main" will require nothing on initial data entry, but will need extra
     information upon completion (what is the extra information?)

   - "Service" to require a valid PremiseNumber (do we get a list of
   PremiseNumbers?)

9. We'll need further consideration into the idea of "nesting" work orders
   together, i.e., should restoration on a work order spawn and exist as
   a new work order?

10. Need to get the table of contractors into the system.

11. Incorporate Lat/Lon picker (with Coordinate object).

12. Once an asset has been chosen or a street address entered, need to display
    table of all work orders recorded for that given asset and/or address.  It
    should constantly be filtered as data is entered.  This table should also
    provide a system to expand the scope of what's been brought back, to entire
    street, or a specified radius of the Lat/Lon that's been picked.

13. Need to attach documents similarly to how MapCall already does (notes
    are a straight db field, is this ok?)

14. Priority may need to be setup as an OpCode-configured system, like AssetType
    above, and OperatingCenterStockedMaterials from the initial design.  Is this
    really necessary?  It's extra work, and may make reporting more difficult.
    If it is, we need to decide what the static values should be (if any), and
    start with the values necessary for NJ7.

15. MarkoutRequired to become MarkoutRequirement, with a separate class/table.
    Values are "None", "Routine", and "Emergency".  Add field
    MarkoutRequestNumber (need to know type/validation), and PlannedStartDate.
    This will display as a table int he "Markouts" tab in the edit screen,
    which will provide the ability to re-request.

16. OneCallExpress - need to find out if/how we'll be linking to them for
    Markouts.

17. The Search screen should have the following fields:
  Work Order Number
  Town
  Town Section
  Street
  Nearest Cross Street
  Asset Type
  Asset ID/Premise #
  Status
  Date Started
  Date Requested
  Date Completed
  Markout Ready?
  Markout Number
  Markout Expiration Date

18. The Search Results table should have the following columns:
  Town/Address
  Asset
  Description of Work
  Markout Ready
  Dig Date
  Priority
  "Assign" link, which pops up

19. The Search Results screen should allow batch assignments.  This will entail
    an "Assign Job" column when the search specified search for all open orders.
    Also, a box at the bottom for the employee (foreman) to assign to, and
    another box for truck/crew number for those op centers that don't want to
    assign work directly to foremen (is this necessary for NJ7?)

20. The Markouts entry screen should have the following fields:
  Markout Number
  Date

21. The Planning tab (still to be added) should include the following:
  Markout Dates (read-only, from the Markouts tab)
  Street Opening Permits?
  Traffic Control (drop down)

Finished:
  Search For Planning:
    Fields:
      - Town
      - Town Section
      - Street
      - Nearest Cross Street
      - Asset Type
      - Description of Work (multi-select)?
      - Priority
      - Date Received (date range)
      - Requester
      - Markout Requirement

  Incorporate the Lat/Lon stuff in this somehow, whether it's completely functional or not.
  
  Need a new table of Materials & Stock (Part) Numbers.  That field should use the autosuggest control,
  displaying both part number and small description.  This is pending, I need it from Doug.
  
  A part number is tied to a size, so that should not be a field on the form.
  
  Need a map tab, to show where the job is located.
  
Pending:
  "Field Ops Dashboard":
    Need a graph of jobs created, in planning, and scheduled.
  
  For initial input, need buttons to cut right out to planning or scheduling right after saving.
  
  Need work order "Phases" -- Initial, Planning, Scheduling, Execution, and Finalization.
  
  Equipment is maintained at the op center level.  This also includes Vehicles from the currently
  existing vehicles table, so two drop downs are in order, with two separate tables which will
  union together somehow.
  
  Markout Number can only be 9 digits (the table allows for 15).
  
  Need to link to the State's traffic control plans (pdf) from the traffic control tab.
  
  Need a Customer tab:
    - Notify Customer (check box)
      - # of Customers notified
    - Alert In System (check box)
  
  Planning Tabs:
    - 
  
  Search For Planning:
    Need to be able to map the table that comes up when you do a search within planning.
  
  Need some sort of "Dashboard", to see what work is currently in planning and scheduling.  Kevin Kirwan
  to provide a list of the Descriptions of Work with the estimated man hours.  This allows them to see
  what's currently pending, and how long all of it is going to take.
  
  Scheduling Search:
    - Need a date field to search for markouts which are to expire within x number of days.

    - Need to sort the results table for scheduling by any visible field.

  Closing:
    - If there was an emergency order, it should skip planning & scheduling (optionally).
      Any required data for closing should be forced as a requirement here.

***********************************************************************************************************

PENDING:
Planning Search:
  - Need to filter Description of Work by Asset Type once chosen.

  - Description of Work needs to be multi-select (don't know why it's not already)

Emergency Markouts do not expire per se, but last as long as the emergency and work
is being done.

Need some way of viewing what work is already assigned to crews along with the estimated
man hours so that the administrator can see how many hours of work has been assigned for
a day.

Need a crews table.  Need a string field for crew descriptor, and it should allow for each
OpCenter to create and maintain its own set of crews.

Planning Detail:
  - "Equipment" to become "Resources".  Contains both vehicles and equipment.  Need some
    way to allow for an administrator to decide what shows up in these lists.

Planning:
  Markouts:
    - Need to record radius here.  This will be passed along with the rest of the information, including
      lat/lon, to OneCall via email, so they can process and get us a markout number.

    - OneCall will be sending us emails with the markout numbers.

  Traffic Control:
    - Local use checkbox? to flag that a set of work should be batch planned.

Planning (perhaps v2):
  -  Need means to record what officers were on site, and the invoice number (attached document).

  
***********************************************************************************************************

  PLANNING:
    DETAIL:
      MAP TAB:
        - The icon should not be draggable.

      TRAFFIC CONTROL TAB:
        - Is Traffic Control Required? should be on the INPUT form.  This checkbox
          can stay, but should be disabled on this form.

        - Need # of officers required.

      STREET OPENING PERMIT TAB:
        - Record that the permit was applied for, the date that happened, received,
          the date that happened, and an expiration date.

      SOME TAB:
        - Kevin Keane to provide sheets with the accounting numbers for given job
          descriptions on assets within different towns, as well as a list of the
          descriptions to differentiate between O&M/Capital so that the correct
          Accounting Number can be applied to a work order.  Once the system has
          determined the proper accounting number, the user should be able to
          change the number if necessary.  Later on, in EmployeeWorkOrder (time
          sheet) entry, changing the job description will need to redo the same
          process.

    SEARCH RESULTS TABLE:
      - Need map button.  Once the map is open, it should include a button to show
        all open Work Orders within the current extents.  This needs safety checks
        to ensure that too much data doesn't get thrown at the map.

    DOCUMENTS:
      PLANNING:
        - Street Opening Permit

      SCHEDULING/FINALIZATION:
        - Invoices from police required for traffic control

***********************************************************************************************************
01/19/2009
  PLANNING:
    Street Opening Permits - just like traffic control or markouts, need:
      Permit Required? (bool) and Notes (text)
    Will also need to display the town phone number, and contact info in the tab in planning (at some point).

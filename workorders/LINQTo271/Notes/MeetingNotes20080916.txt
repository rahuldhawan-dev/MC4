FINISHED:
  INPUT SCREEN:
   - Need Nearest Cross Street always.

   - Add "Call Center" requested by. (the rest is still pending)

   - Pressure Complaints?  Need to get Description of Work broken out into asset type
     and then the type of work to be done on said asset.  This will change.
   
   - Lat/Lon picker needs to get worked into create somewhere.

   - Once an asset has been chosen, need to display table of all work orders recorded
     for that given asset. (works for valves/hydrants, rest are pending)

   - Add "Description of Work" - filtered by asset type.

   - Add "Call Center" requested by.  Then need service order # (required), and
     premise #.

   - Need phone # for customer again, as well as additional phone #, and service
     order number (optional, still not there?  or is that service number?).

   - "Service ID" (Asset Type == Service) to become "Premise Number", and show
     associated local identifier.
     - This may necessarily be "set" when description of work is set.  (does not,
       actually works the other way round.  choosing "service" as AssetType allows
       the user to choose a Description of Work).

   - "Markout Required" becomes "Markout Requirement".  "None", "Routine", "Emergency".

  PLANNING:
   - Add fields Markout Request #, Planned Start Date.  These will display as a table in
     the "Markouts" tab in the edit screen, which will also provide the ability to "re-request".

   FIELDS:
    - Markout Dates
    - Street Opening Permits (requirement/?) (became checkbox in input)
    - Traffic Control (drop down) (became checkbox in input)
      - "None", "Pending Confirmation", "Confirmed"
      - Span availiable if Multi Dat
 
   - Single/Multi Day (this is somewhat inherent in the current design of crew assignments)

   SCHEDULING:
    Allow to assign work to an Employee (foreman), or a free-form text field for
    crew (truck, etc.).  (this works using Crews and Crew Assignments)
    Work by town, so a supervisor would be given a town to schedule work within for
    his crews.
    Need to record date work is scheduled.

    Need a "Sequence", to specify what order work should be done in.  Supervisor would
    then open up an employee's assigned work, and specify (click & drag) what order
    the employee sould complete the work in.

   CREW ASSIGNMENTS:
    "Work assigned to me"; essentially when an employee finishes a job they can see
    the next nearest job. (this is builtin to the Crew Assignments page)

PENDING:
  GENERAL:
   - Need some way of "nesting" work orders together, as they may be related work
     or steps in a process.  This is because restorations need to be logically separate
     from work orders themselves.  Work orders can be "completed" before the restoration
     is finished, but that work order (parent) will contain the restoration section in
     a tab.

  INPUT SCREEN:
   - Spoils?

	/* I DON'T THINK THE NEXT ONE WILL HAPPEN */
   - Need "Add Street" button to add a street if it's not been found.  Then need some
     way of pulling a report of all the streets that have been added by a given user
     to verify that the data entered is consistent.

	/* THE NEXT ONE WILL NOT HAPPEN */
   - Asset Type will need to include "Main-Sewer", "Main-Water", "Manhole",
     "Meter Pit".  Perhaps these need to get filtered by OpCode, as to which each
     OpCode will have.

   - Once an asset has been chosen, need to display table of all work orders recorded
     for that given asset. (this is finished, except for services.  following is not)
     This table should also provide a system to expand the scope of what's been brought
     back, to entire street, or a specified radius of the Lat/Lon that's been picked.

  FINALIZATION:
   - Need to pull in the table of contractors per op center.

   - Need extra Main information upon completion?

   - Need to attach documents and notes to work orders.

	/* I DON'T THINK THE NEXT ONE WILL HAPPEN AS WRITTEN */
   - Need to display the possible duplicates table once street address AND/OR asset id
     has been filled.  It should be constantly filtered as information is entered.
     (we should be able to eventually expand/narrow the "duplicates" table based on
      address information)

	/* THE NEXT ONE WILL NOT HAPPEN */
   - Priority needs to perhaps be setup as an OpCode-configured system, like Asset Type
     above, and Stocked Materials.

   - Will perhaps need to connect to One Call Express.

   PLANNING:
    Materials Planned (optional)
    Equipment (per OpCode, optional, just like materials but they don't go away)
    Need a "Sequence", to specify what order work should be done in.

    Calendar of all materials needed for a given set of days.

   SCHEDULING:
    Will need to generate and email work order assignments to administrators.

    "Assigned but not Scheduled"?

    /* THE NEXT ONE WILL NOT HAPPEN */
    Employees on trucks (foreman) should be able to log in and see "trivial" jobs
    open, things which require no markout.

    Need ability to do a batch print of work orders.  This probably means that they'll
    see a table of search results, but we'll then need to print the details of the
    order as it pertains to the work an employee will be doing.

FINISHED:
  SHEDULING:
    Need to record estimated times for given descriptions of work, and "estimated contract value".
    (should be getting this from Kevin Kirwan) (this is somewhat implemented.  a list of estimated
     times was provided, and they are used when scheduling to fill up a crew's work shift by their
     hours of availability)

PENDING:
  PLANNING AND FINALIZATION:
    Materials to be filtered by asset type for a given work order.

  GENERAL:
    Some descriptions of work will require that asset records be updated.  No idea how, that's big.
    And it requires a tighter integration with the rest of the site, which is gonna be tough to do.

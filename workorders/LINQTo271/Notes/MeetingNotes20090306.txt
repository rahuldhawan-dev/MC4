FINISHED:
  INPUT:
    1.  Town, Town Section, Street Number, Street, Nearest X Street, and Zip Code, in that order.

    2.  They need to plot the location of a Main Break.  This cuts through the entire design quite nicely.

    4.  Work Order seems to have double inserted?  72978 on live server.


  ANY PAGE WITH SEARCH AND RESULTS, AS WELL AS THE INITIAL INPUT TAB SHOULD ASK FOR/DISPLAY THE NEW WORK ORDER # AND THE OLD WORK ORDER #.


  RESTORATION:
    1.  The 2nd field down should be required, as well as type.

    3.  They need a "Done" button next to "Edit".  Also "Edit" is broken.

  FINALIZATION:
    1.  Need "Is the work complete?".


PENDING:
  INPUT:
    3.  Need to be able to record Work Orders for assets which may or may not exist.  This is for cases where they're sent out
        to fix an asset which may not belong to them, or may not necessarily exist in the system.


  PLANNING:
    1.  Deleting a Markout doesn't work.

    2.  Search results table needs to show the street number, and the initial info tab needs to show it as well.


  SCHEDULING:
    1.  They need to be able to schedule work in advance of the markout ready date.  This is difficult because
        they could then concevably chose a "for date" that falls before the markout will be ready.  The page
        will need to check for this, disallow it, and prompt the user in an intelligent manner.


  FINALIZATION:
    1.  Need to have a street number field in the search page.


  CREW ASSIGNMENTS:
    1.  Table should be read only unless the chosen date is today.


  ANY SEARCH RESULT TABLE:
    1.  Need a count of the records returned at the top.


  NEED A GENERAL WORK ORDER SEARCH PAGE.


  RESTORATION:
    2.  They want length x width instead of Paving Square Footage.

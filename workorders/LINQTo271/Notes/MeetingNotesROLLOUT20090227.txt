FINISHED:
WORK ORDER INPUT:
1.  "Premise Number" is the ServiceID.  That field needs to be displayed, and duplicates should be found based on that field.
    Need to determine which table(s) on the site to complete it from, and which tables in the input data it should come from.

2.  A "Service Number" field is needed as well, also for services.  "Premise Number" to be required, "Service Number" optional.

4.  When selecting Middletown, the street drop down breaks, here's the inner error:
    {"Message":"Error during serialization or deserialization using the JSON JavaScriptSerializer. The length
     of the string exceeds the value set on the maxJsonLength property.","StackTrace":"   at System.Web.Script
     .Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer.Serialize(Object obj, StringBuilder output, SerializationFormat serializationFormat
     )\r\n   at System.Web.Script.Serialization.JavaScriptSerializer.Serialize(Object obj, SerializationFormat
      serializationFormat)\r\n   at System.Web.Script.Services.RestHandler.InvokeMethod(HttpContext context
      , WebServiceMethodData methodData, IDictionary`2 rawParams)\r\n   at System.Web.Script.Services.RestHandler
      .ExecuteWebServiceCall(HttpContext context, WebServiceMethodData methodData)","ExceptionType":"System
      .InvalidOperationException"}

    This was an error due to the sheer number of streets in Middletown.  It was also occuring in other towns
	with a big list of streets.  I've doubled the size of JSON strings that ASP.Net AJAX will handle, hopefully
	as a self-adhesive bandage (band-aid®) for now.

PENDING:
WORK ORDER INPUT:
3.  Need a way to display all work orders.

5.  "Date Received" - the time is being ignored, so is getting set to midnight.  Need to fix that.

6.  "Requested By" - Employee - the label shows but the drop down doesn't.  As a quick fix for now,
    just a drop down with employee numbers?

CREW ASSIGNMENTS:
1.  When clicking "end", a confirm needs to display "Is the work complete?".  Clicking "no" will simply enter
    the date, clicking "yes" will bring them to the finalization screen for that work order (somehow).

PLANNING:
1.  Planning needs to be implemented.


SCHEDULING:
1.  Need "Priority" in the search page.


FINALIZATION:
1.  The Part # search is broken on the site.


DATA CLEANSING:
1.  Go through existing work orders, and fix their street based on the asset's street.

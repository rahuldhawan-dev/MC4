FINISHED:
  Legend for assignment calendar.  New color schedule:
    0%          - White
    > 0% to 50% - Green
    50% to 100% - Yellow
    > 100%      - Red

  SCHEDULING:
    Add drop down to search "Pending Assignment?" to filter the list by whether or not there has been
    an assignment for a given order that has not yet come to pass.

    SEARCH:
      Need field to specify estimated TTC, > 1 hr, > 2 hrs, < 2hrs.

    SEARCH RESULTS:
      Estimated TTC to go next to Description of Job.

  CREW ASSIGNMENTS:
    Need to display a monthly calendar first, and then the specific day schedule when a day is chosen from there.

    From read-only assignments, need to be able to print out the assignment list.  The Work Order data
    should be formatted in the same way that the current Access file does for a certain report.
    PRINT OUT REPORT ->
      "rptFieldServiceWorkOrderNew"

PENDING:
  Need to be able to change the assignment date for work orders, from the SingleDay list.  Need a link
  from that table to a specialized Work Order screen showing relevant information such as Markout Expiration
  date.  Will also need to ensure that a Work Order will still be ready.

  Markout expiration works by calendar days?

  PLANNING:
    Street Opening Permits - just like traffic control or markouts, need:
      Permit Required? (bool) and Notes (text)
    Will also need to display the town phone number, and contact info in the tab in planning (at some point).

  SCHEDULING:
    SEARCH RESULTS:
      Need a comma-delimited list of any resources that were specified for a given job in the planning phase.

  MARKOUTS:
    Markout ready dates are based on business days, but the expiration date is based on work days (with no
    consideration to holidays).

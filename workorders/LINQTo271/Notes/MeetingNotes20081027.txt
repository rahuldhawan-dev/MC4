  Incorporate the Lat/Lon stuff in this somehow, whether it's completely functional or not.
  
  Need a new table of Materials & Stock (Part) Numbers.  That field should use the autosuggest control,
  displaying both part number and small description.  This is pending, I need it from Doug.
  
  A part number is tied to a size, so that should not be a field on the form.
  
  Need a map tab, to show where the job is located.
  
  Need work order "Phases" -- Initial, Planning, Scheduling, Execution, and Finalization.
  
Pending:
  "Field Ops Dashboard":
    Need a graph of jobs created, in planning, and scheduled.
  
  For initial input, need buttons to cut right out to planning or scheduling right after saving.
  
  Equipment is maintained at the op center level.  This also includes Vehicles from the currently
  existing vehicles table, so two drop downs are in order, with two separate tables which will
  union together somehow.
  
  Markout Number can only be 9 digits (the table allows for 15).
  
  Need to link to the State's traffic control plans (pdf) from the traffic control tab.
  
  Need a Customer tab:
    - Notify Customer (check box)
      - # of Customers notified
    - Alert In System (check box)
  
  Planning Tabs:
    - 
  
  Search For Planning:
    Need to be able to map the table that comes up when you do a search within planning.
  
  Need some sort of "Dashboard", to see what work is currently in planning and scheduling.  Kevin Kirwan
  to provide a list of the Descriptions of Work with the estimated man hours.  This allows them to see
  what's currently pending, and how long all of it is going to take.
  
  Scheduling Search:
    - Need a date field to search for markouts which are to expire within x number of days.

    - Need to sort the results table for scheduling by any visible field.

  Closing:
    - If there was an emergency order, it should skip planning & scheduling (optionally).
      Any required data for closing should be forced as a requirement here.

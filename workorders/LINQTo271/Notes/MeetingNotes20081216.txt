FINISHED:
  INPUT:
    - Need street number for the actual job, not just customer.

    - Need to include 2nd phone number for customer.  Already in the model/db,
	  just need to add to the form.

    - Need Is Traffic Control Required? checkbox.

  PLANNING:
    DETAIL:
      MAP TAB:
        - The icon should not be draggable.

      TRAFFIC CONTROL TAB:
        - Is Traffic Control Required? should be on the INPUT form.  This checkbox
          can stay, but should be disabled on this form.

        - Need # of officers required.

PENDING:
  INPUT:
    HISTORY TABLE:
      - Need some sort of icon to show whether a historical work order has
        attached documents.

  PLANNING:
    DETAIL:
      STREET OPENING PERMIT TAB:
        - Record that the permit was applied for, the date that happened, received,
          the date that happened, and an expiration date.

      SOME TAB:
        - Kevin Keane to provide sheets with the accounting numbers for given job
          descriptions on assets within different towns, as well as a list of the
          descriptions to differentiate between O&M/Capital so that the correct
          Accounting Number can be applied to a work order.  Once the system has
          determined the proper accounting number, the user should be able to
          change the number if necessary.  Later on, in EmployeeWorkOrder (time
          sheet) entry, changing the job description will need to redo the same
          process.

    SEARCH RESULTS TABLE:
      - Need map button.  Once the map is open, it should include a button to show
        all open Work Orders within the current extents.  This needs safety checks
        to ensure that too much data doesn't get thrown at the map.

    DOCUMENTS:
      PLANNING:
        - Street Opening Permit

      SCHEDULING/FINALIZATION:
        - Invoices from police required for traffic control

  WORK/PROCESSING:
    - Field images

  GENERAL:
    - Need to differentiate between materials required (planning) and materials
      used/scrapped/returned (work time sheets/completion).  In future, we'll
      need an intermediate step between Planning and Scheduling where a stock
      clerk would have to go through pending work and certify that the required
      materials are there and work can proceed.

SOX compliance is a pain in the ass.

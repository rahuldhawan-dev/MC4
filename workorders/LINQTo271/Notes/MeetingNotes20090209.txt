FINISHED:
  Restoration:
    Need header lines to divide between the Partial and Final fields.
  
    Need to send Doug the list of Types of Restoration and Methods of Final Restoration so he can match the parent/child relationship.

    Need to show Linear Ft. Of Curb when Type Of Restoration involves curb, and Paving Square Footage otherwise.
  
    Pull Method of Final Asphalt Repair values and stick them into a table.
  
    Need to turn this into a one-to-many.  The basic table in the tab should show Type of Restoration and the sq. footage, and the
	'Select' link will open that form in a popup.

    Change 'Partial' to 'Initial'.

    Add 'Method of Initial Repair', and any other fields that 'Final' has, but 'Partial' (now 'Initial') does not.

    The RestorationMethods are going to change, there needs to be a separate list for 'Initial' and 'Final'.

    Remote the word 'Asphalt'.

    Approved By and Rejected By are users, should automatically be the user that filled in the date and hit 'save'.
  
PENDING:
  Restoration:
    Partial Restoration By and Final Restoration By are drop downs filled out by a list of contractors.  See the existing form for this.
  
    This table needs to get merged out to the existing Restoration table.
  
    Will need to eventually use Size of Hole instead of Paving Square Footage.

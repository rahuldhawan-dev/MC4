FINISHED:
  Crew Management:
    Editing crew name did not work.

    Need to record and use "Crew Availability", int, # of hours.

  Work Assignment:
    Insert time estimates for descriptions of work.

    Need some sort of secondary priority for work as it's been scheduled, aside from the base work order
    priority (what order should the crew do the work in).

    The "schedule meter" should work up to the shift length of the given crew, based on the estimated time
    to complete for the work descriptions for the assigned work.

    Needs to happen by day.  This should include a date field on the list resulting from scheduling work.

  Scheduling Search:
    Need Assigned? drop down (to work like traffic control and markout requirement).

    Need Description of Work (duh).

    Need Markout Expiration Date.

    The screen after assigning should show the crew used and their assigned work.  (Calendar/table).

  Restoration already exists, we'll need to link to that somehow.

PENDING:
  Scheduling Search:
    Need the results to be sortable.

    Need to perhaps keep a running total of how many hours of work have been selected, up until
    the "Assign" button is clicked.

  Date Range Control:
    Some of the operators (besides "=") need the first text box to dissappear.

  Need to discuss the O&M & Capital stuff.

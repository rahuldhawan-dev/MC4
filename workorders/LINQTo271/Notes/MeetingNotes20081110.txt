FINISHED:
  Need some way of viewing what work is already assigned to crews along with the estimated
  man hours so that the administrator can see how many hours of work has been assigned for
  a day.

  Need a crews table.  Need a string field for crew descriptor, and it should allow for each
  OpCenter to create and maintain its own set of crews.

  Planning Search:
    - Description of Work needs to be multi-select (don't know why it's not already)

PENDING:
  Planning Search:
    - Need to filter Description of Work by Asset Type once chosen.

  Emergency Markouts do not expire per se, but last as long as the emergency and work
  is being done.

  Planning Detail:
    - "Equipment" to become "Resources".  Contains both vehicles and equipment.  Need some
      way to allow for an administrator to decide what shows up in these lists.

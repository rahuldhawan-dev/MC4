FINISHED:

  Input:
    Street opening requirement (yes, no, to be determined) (implemented as checkbox)

    Traffic control requirement (yes, no, to be determined) (implemented as checkbox)

    Main breaks won't have an asset?  Not sure how to record a work order without one.  Perhaps a temporary
    main asset could be created based off of the lat/lon. (this just works.  the asset system was hacked to fit)

  Planning:
    Traffic Control:
      - Do you need traffic control (check box)

    Markouts:
      - Need to record radius here.  This will be passed along with the rest of the information, including
        lat/lon, to OneCall via email, so they can process and get us a markout number.

  LatLonPicker:
    Need to click and drag the point over to where it belongs, and on close it should ask if the chosen point is
    ok.

PENDING:

  One Call:
    Need to perhaps draw a 10x10' square around a given point (asset) to provide to OneCall for a markout.  This
    should be pretty easy, just need to figure out how to translate degrees to feet.

  Input:
    The possibility of seeing a localized map of valves limited to a couple of streets so they could pick a valve
    from the map was mentioned.  This would help with street/cross street issues.  It will take some time and
    planning though.

    Some means to record who set a latitude/longitude for an asset.

  General:
    Still need to attach documents to work orders.

    Remove "Revenue Related" from priority.

  Planning:
    Markouts:
      - OneCall will be sending us emails with the markout numbers.

    Traffic Control:
      - Local use checkbox? to flag that a set of work should be batch planned.

  Scheduling:
    Special notification email address per town.  The town already has this in the town table.  This could be
    county as well.

  Finalization (perhaps v2):
    -  Need means to record what officers were on site, and the invoice number (attached document).

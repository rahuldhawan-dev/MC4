* Expectations
** T&D Side
*** Hydrants, Valves, Manholes (need sample), Streets, Valve Inspections, Hydrant Inspections (need sample)
**** Images eventually
*** Prevents programmers from having to validate data prior to importing data
**** Manual vs. New Process
***** Manual
****** Doug gives us an excel file, we upload to a temp table, process, validate feedback when necessary
****** Data is moved to actual table from temp after processing
***** New
****** Auto-determines file type
****** Validates records in file
****** Imports to DEV if validation passes

** Doug's role in new process
*** Runs validation/import against DEV for varification
*** If licensing is OK, runs validation/import against QA
*** Sends valid files to developers to load to live

** Production Side
*** Facilities (need sample), Equipment (need more samples)

** Updates as opposed to imports?
